# go-bb [golang building blocks project.]

This project is for checking in:
1. Sample code.
2. Examples during topics mastery.
3. Components that can be used later.

Also I write test cases and classes for all of them so that can write better TDD code.

Topics covered.
1. Structs
2. Pointers
3. Files
4. Concurrency
5. OS module and command execution.
